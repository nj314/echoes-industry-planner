# echoes-industry-planner

A planning tool for industrialists in Eve Echoes. Produces estimates about profits/losses based on the player's current inventory, reprocessing skills, manufacturing skills, and market data.

## Powered by the community

This tool is intended to be open to PRs from the community for blueprint corrections, additions, and any other enhancements as the game receives updates over time. The `game-model` module contains all BP and relevant skill definitions, and should make it easy to submit PRs in response to game patches.

## Deployment

Branch `master` is continuously-deployed to Github Pages at https://nj314.github.io/echoes-industry-planner/

## Market data

Unfortunately, market data input is all manual as CCP hasn't yet made a public API for Echoes market data. When this changes, open an issue!
